<p>What is space? </p>

<p> space is everything in the universe beyond the top of the Earth's atmosphere – the Moon, where the GPS satellites orbit, Mars, other 
stars, the Milky Way, black holes, and distant quasars</p>

<p>Why is it called space? </p>

<p>The English word space originates from the Latin word for expanse - spatium (also written spacium in Medieval Latin), and later the French 
word espace, through the use of which English variant space was formed. Of incorporeal speed, her warmth, and light; Speed, to describe 
whose swiftness number fails.</p>

<p>What is space made up of? </p>

<p>The Universe is thought to consist of three types of substance: normal matter, 'dark matter', and 'dark energy'. Normal matter consists 
of the atoms that make up stars, planets, human beings, and every other visible object in the Universe.</p>

<p>who first discovered space? </p>

<p>Edwin Hubble: The man who discovered the Cosmos.</p>

<p>How big is space? </p>

<p>about 93 billion light-years
The proper distance—the distance as would be measured at a specific time, including the present—between Earth and the edge of the 
observable universe is 46 billion light-years (14 billion parsecs), making the diameter of the observable universe about 93 billion light-
years (28 billion parsecs).</p>

<p>How was space formed? </p>

<p>Our universe began with an explosion of space itself - the Big Bang. Starting from extremely high density and temperature, space 
expanded, the universe cooled, and the simplest elements formed. Gravity gradually drew matter together to form the first stars and the 
first galaxies.</p>

<p>how is space infinite?</p>

<p>There's a limit to how much of the universe we can see. The observable universe is finite in that it hasn't existed forever. It extends 
46 billion light years in every direction from us. (While our universe is 13.8 billion years old, the observable universe reaches further 
since the universe is expanding) </p>
