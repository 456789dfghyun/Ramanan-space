<head>The first contact with the aliens </head>
<body>
<p> Humans’ “first contact” with aliens is likely to be with a civilization much more technologically advanced than ours, according to a new
NASA-funded study into the search for intelligent extraterrestrial life (SETI). 

According to the paper published in the specialized journal Acta Astronautica, the easiest way to detect extraterrestrial civilizations is 
by searching for “technosignatures”—evidence for the use of technology or industrial activity in other parts of the Universe. 

Technosignatures, many of which are based on how Earth might look now, or in the past or future, to alien onlookers, include:</p>

<ol>

<li>Radio signals, such as the Arecibo message we humans sent in the direction of globular star cluster M13 on November 16, 1974.</li>

<li>The presence of industrial pollution in the atmosphere of a planet. For example, the presence of nitrogen dioxide—as studied recently by
the same team of researchers—or the wholly artificial chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), both of which are evidence for there being a technologically 
advanced civilization on Earth.</li> 

<li>Large swarms of satellites around a planet.</li>

<li>Gigantic space engineering around exoplanets, such as heat shields or “Dyson spheres” that harvest solar energy from the local star.</li>

<li>Crash sites on the Moon or Mars of probes that might have been sent here in a distant past. </li>

</ol>

<p>However, the study—which was funded by NASA Goddard’s Sellers Exoplanet Environments Collaboration (SEEC) and the NASA Exobiology 
program—argues that our search for technosignatures would likely only be successful at finding much more advanced technology than humans 
can currently create. That raises the specter of “contact inequality.”

“It seems unlikely that civilizations with a relatively low level of technological development would enter into contact with each other, 
since that would require either very high sensitivities or highly visible engineering,” reads the paper. “Less advanced civilizations lack
the sensitivity needed to detect other civilizations unless they have built very large or luminous structures.” 

In short, we don’t yet have instruments sensitive enough to definitively find “another Earth” by detecting an alien civilization outright.

That’s despite huge advances in our astronomical instrumentation in the past decade that have revolutionized the science of discovery and 
study of exoplanets, which now number 4,000+.</p>

<p>“For us to detect such signals at interstellar distances with our current sensitivities, such signals would need to be stronger than 
those produced by current human civilization, particularly the unintentional ones,” read the paper. “Only those species that have 
constructed or developed technology is much larger or more luminous than any of our own can be detected with our current astronomical 
infrastructure.” 

So we’re looking for massive, unmistakable signs of alien civilizations far more advanced than we are.

“The idea of searching for technosignatures draws upon the technology we have on Earth today and possible extensions of our technology 
into the future,” said Jacob Haqq-Misra, a co-author of the article and chairman of the TechnoClimes 2020 organizing committee. “This does
not necessarily mean that any extraterrestrial technology must be like our own, but imagining plausible extensions of our own future is 
one place to begin thinking of astronomical searches we could actually do to look for possible technosignatures.”

The study puts forward a plan, and a new way of classifying the technosignatures as a function of their “cosmic footprint”—the relative 
size scale of a given techno signature in units of the same techno signature produced by current Earth technology. It’s a measure of how 
easy to see a techno signature0 might be from a huge distance. The researchers call this an “ichnoscale.” 

Scale and scope is tricky since a search for crashed spacecraft on the Moon could easily be done, whereas a search for Dyson spheres in 
our galaxy would have a billion potential targets, according to the paper. 

Don’t get the idea that armies of astronomers and NASA scientists are spending their days and nights searching for traces of 
extraterrestrial intelligence. They're not. In fact, the renewed interest in “techno signature science” is largely down to the fact that it
can be done purely by taking advantage of data that is already being collected for astronomical purposes.

For example, many space telescopes and survey satellites—such as TESS—observe stars to see if exoplanets are transiting across them.
That’s exactly the same science that needs to be done to search for technosignatures.

The next generation of telescopes—such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), but many others—will also, for the first time, allow a 
search for so-called biomarkers, evidence for life on other planets. While characterizing the atmosphere of an exoplanet it will by 
default
 
detect the presence of, say, CFCs or nitrogen dioxide.

It’s therefore something of a free hit, according to the researchers—the modern search for aliens can be all about synergy.

A free hit it may be, but it could also be a fruitless one. “We have no idea whether intelligence is something very common in the Universe
or, on the contrary, whether it is extremely rare,” said Hector Socas-Navarro, an IAC researcher, the Director of the Museum of Science 
and the Cosmos, of Museums of Tenerife, and the first author of the paper.

“For that reason, we cannot know whether these searches have any chance of success. There is no choice but to search and see what we find 
because the implications would be tremendous.”
