<p>What is a universe? </p>

<p>The Universe is the biggest and contains billions of galaxies. A galaxy is a huge collection of gas, dust, and billions of stars and their solar systems, all held together by gravity.
 Our galaxy is called the Milky Way galaxy.</p>

<p>How is a universe created?</p>

<p>Our universe began with an explosion of space itself - the Big Bang. Starting from extremely high density and temperature, space expanded, the universe cooled, and the simplest elements 
formed. Gravity gradually drew matter together to form the first stars and the first galaxies.</p>

<p>What was there before the universe?</p>

<p>In the beginning, there was an infinitely dense, tiny ball of matter. Then, it all went bang, giving rise to the atoms, molecules, stars, and galaxies we see today. Or at least, that's 
what we've been told by physicists for the past several decades.</p>

<p>How long will the universe exist?</p>

<p>22 billion years in the future is the earliest possible end of the Universe in the Big Rip scenario, assuming a model of dark energy with w = âˆ’1.5. False vacuum decay may occur in 20 to 
30 billion years if the Higgs field is metastable.</p>
