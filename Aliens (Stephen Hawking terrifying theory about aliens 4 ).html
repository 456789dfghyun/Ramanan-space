<head>Stephen Hawking terrifying theory about aliens</head>
<body>
<p>Is Stephen Hawking right about aliens?</p>

<p>Stephen Hawking thinks that making contact with aliens would be a very bad idea indeed. But with new, massive telescopes, we humans are 
stepping up the search. Have we really thought this through?</p>

<p>In February 2008, Nasa sent the Beatles' song, Across the Universe. Pointing the telescopes in its Deep Space Network towards the north 
star, Polaris, astronomers played out their short cosmic DJ set, hoping that it might be heard by intelligent aliens during its 430-year 
journey to the star.</p>

<p>The hunt for intelligent species outside Earth may be a staple of literature and film – but it is happening in real life, too. Nasa 
probes are on the lookout for planets outside our solar system, and astronomers are carefully listening for any messages being beamed 
through space. How awe-inspiring it would be to get confirmation that we are not alone in the universe, to finally speak to an alien race. 
Wouldn't it?</p>

<p>Well no, according to the eminent physicist Stephen Hawking. "If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in 
America, which didn't turn out well for the Native Americans," Hawking has said in a forthcoming documentary made for the Discovery Channel. 
He argues that, instead of trying to find and communicate with life in the cosmos, humans would be better off doing everything they can to 
avoid contact.</p>

<p>Hawking believes that, based on the sheer number of planets that scientists know must exist, we are not the only life form in the 
universe. There are, after all, billions and billions of stars in our galaxy alone, with, it is reasonable to expect, an even greater number 
of planets orbiting them. And it is not unreasonable to expect some of that alien life to be intelligent, and capable of interstellar 
communication. So, when someone with Hawking's knowledge of the universe advises against contact, it's worth listening to, isn't it?</p>

<p>Seth Shostak, a senior astronomer at the Seti Institute in California, the world's leading organization searching for telltale alien 
signals, is not so sure. "This is an unwarranted fear," Shostak says. "If their interest in our planet is for something valuable that our 
planet has to offer, there's no particular reason to worry about them now. If they're interested in resources, they have ways of finding 
rocky planets that don't depend on whether we broadcast or not. They could have found us a billion years ago."</p>

<p>If we were really worried about shouting in the stellar jungle, Shostak says, the first thing to do would be to shut down the BBC, NBC, 
CBS and the radars at all airports. Those broadcasts have been streaming into space for years – the oldest is already more than 80 light 
years from Earth – so it is already too late to stop passing aliens watching every episode of Big Brother or What Katie and Peter Did Next.</p>

<p>The biggest and most active hunt for life outside Earth started in 1960 when Frank Drake pointed the Green Bank radio telescope in 
West Virginia towards the star Tau Ceti. He was looking for anomalous radio signals that could have been sent by intelligent life. 
Eventually, his idea turned into Seti (standing for Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence), which used the downtime on radar telescopes 
around the world to scour the sky for any signals. For 50 years, however, the sky has been silent./p

<p>There are lots of practical problems involved in hunting for aliens, of course, chief among them being distance. If our nearest 
neighbors were life forms on the (fictional) forest moon of Endor, 1,000 light years away, it would take a millennium for us to receive 
any message they might send. If the Endorians were watching us, the light reaching them from Earth at this very moment would show them 
our planet as it was 1,000 years ago; in Europe, that means lots of fighting between knights around castles and, in North America, small 
bands of natives living on the great plains. It is not a timescale that allows for quick banter – and, anyway, they might not be 
communicating in our direction.</p>

<p>The lack of a signal from ET has not, however, prevented astronomers and biologists (not to mention filmmakers) from coming up with a whole
range of ideas about what aliens might be like. In the early days of Seti, astronomers focused on the search for planets like ours – the 
idea being that, since the only biology we know about is our own, we might as well assume aliens are going to be something like us. But 
there's no reason why that should be true. You don't even need to step off the Earth to find a life that is radically different from our
common experience of it.</p>


<p>"Extremophiles" are species that can survive in places that would quickly kill humans and other "normal" life-forms. These single-
celled creatures have been found in boiling hot vents of water thrusting through the ocean floor, or at temperatures well below the 
freezing point of water. The front ends of some creatures that live near deep-sea vents are 200C warmer than their back ends.</p>


<p>"In our naive and parochial way, we have named these things extremophiles, which shows prejudice – we're normal, everything else is 
extreme," says Ian Stewart, a mathematician at Warwick University and author of What Does A Martian Look Like? "From the point of view of 
a creature that lives in boiling water, we're extreme because we live in much milder temperatures. We're at least as extreme compared to 
them as they are compared to us."</p>

<p>On Earth, life exists in water and on land but, on a giant gas planet, for example, it might exist high in the atmosphere, trapping 
nutrients from the air swirling around it. And given that aliens may be so out of our experience, guessing motives and intentions if they 
ever got in touch seems beyond the realms even of Hawking's mind.</p>

<p>Paul Davies, an astrophysicist at Arizona State University and chair of Seti's post-detection task force, argues that alien brains, with
their different architecture, would interpret information very differently from ours. What we think of as beautiful or friendly might come
across as violent to them, or vice versa. "Lots of people think that because they would be so wise and knowledgeable, they would be 
peaceful," adds Stewart. "I don't think you can assume that. I don't think you can put human views on them; that's a dangerous way of 
thinking. Aliens are aliens. If they exist at all, we cannot assume they're like us."</p>

<p>Answers to some of these conundrums will begin to emerge in the next few decades. The researchers at the forefront of the work are 
astrobiologists, working in an area that has steadily marched in from the fringes of science thanks to the improvements in technology 
available to explore space.</p>

<p>Scientists discovered the first few extrasolar planets in the early 1990s and, ever since, the numbers have shot up. Today, scientists 
know of 443 planets orbiting around more than 350 stars. Most are gas giants in the mould of Jupiter, the smallest being Gliese 581, which
has a mass of 1.9 Earths. In 2009, Nasa launched the Kepler satellite, a probe specifically designed to look for Earth-like planets.</p>
