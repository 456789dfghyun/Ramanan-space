<p><bold>The Kardashev scale: Classifying alien civilizations</bold></p>

<p>What might we find: little green men or microbes? How might we find them: radio waves or strange chemicals in the planet's atmosphere? 
Something no one has even thought of yet?

Over the decades, scientists considering the possibility of life beyond Earth have pondered what such life might look like, how humans might
be able to identify it from afar â€” and whether communication between the two worlds might be possible.

That thinking has included developing classification systems ready to fill with aliens. One such system is called the Kardashev scale, after
the Soviet astronomer who proposed it in 1964 and evaluates alien civilizations based on the energy they can harness.

The Kardashev scale is a classification system for hypothetical extraterrestrial civilizations. The scale includes three categories based 
on how much energy a civilization is using.</p>

<p>Kardashev describes type I as a "technological level close to the level presently attained on the Earth," type II as "a civilization capable
of harnessing the energy radiated by its own star" and type III as "a civilization in possession of energy on the scale of its own 
galaxy."

Each type also includes a numerical cut-off for the energy involved, but those weren't arbitrary cut-offs. "He used things that are easy 
to visualize," Valentin Ivanov, an astronomer at the European Southern Observatory who has built on Kardashev's work, told Space.com. "I'm
almost tempted to say it's a publicity stunt, these comparisons that he uses to make it easier for people to understand."

Kardashev's scale is included in a five-page paper published in 1964 and called "Transmission of information by extraterrestrial civilizations.
" (The paper was originally published in Russian, but an English translation was published the same year.)

Although the scale is what caught people's imaginations, "Transmission of information by extraterrestrial civilizations" focuses on 
calculating how powerful a light signal from any point of the universe would need to be for radio scientists at the time to detect it. 
This value is also the numerical cut-off for the energy use of a type II civilization.</p>
