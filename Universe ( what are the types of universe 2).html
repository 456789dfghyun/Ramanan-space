<head>What are the types of universe</head>
<body>
<p>There are basically three possible shapes to the Universe; a flat Universe (Euclidean or zero curvature), a spherical or closed Universe 
(positive curvature) or a hyperbolic or open Universe (negative curvature).</p>

<P>How many types of universes are there? </p>

<p>How did you come up with such a figure? We only know of our own universe, the one we presently inhabit a (very) small part of. We can 
measure its properties, constants, and dimensions with considerable accuracy.</p>

<P>But we have no evidence whatever of any other universes. It is speculated that other universes may exist, and it’s a matter of 
speculation as to whether the constants of other universes may differ from our own.</P>

<P>It’s possible that the constants could be VERY different…. Which would result in very different universes.</P>

<P>For instance, if the parameters of gravity were less than what we experience, it’s possible that a universe that formed initially the 
same way ours did would have no stars or planets whatever. Only a vast, diffuse cloud of subatomic particles, unable to form any larger 
structures.</P>

<P>But the possibilities in this regard are very much larger than “3”.</P>
