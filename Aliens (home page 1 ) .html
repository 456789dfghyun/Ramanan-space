<p>What are Aliens</>

<p>Extraterrestrial life colloquially referred to as alien life, is a life that may occur outside Earth and which did not originate on Earth.
No extraterrestrial life has yet been conclusively detected, although efforts are underway. Such life might range from simple forms like 
prokaryotes to intelligent beings, possibly bringing forth civilizations that might be far more advanced than humankind. The Drake equation 
speculates about the existence of sapient life elsewhere in the universe. The science of extraterrestrial life is known as astrobiology.</p>

<p>When Did Humans First Consider the Possibility of Alien Life</p>

<p>The first speculation about what we would call “aliens” goes back to the atomist speculations popular among Epicurean philosophers in 
ancient Greece and their Roman disciples. Democritus and Epicurus considered the universe to be the result of a chance jostling of atoms 
and regarded it as highly likely that there were other worlds out there and that they were inhabited. Epicurus’ disciple Metrodorus of 
Chios considered the idea of our “world” is the only one as unlikely as “if a single ear of wheat grew on a vast plain.” As the Roman 
Epicurean poet Lucretius put it: “Nothing in the universe is unique and alone and therefore in other regions there must be other earth 
inhabited by different tribes of men and breeds of beasts.” to know more about it click the below link</p>

<p> now we know about aliens what are the classifications? there are 43 classifications each has another 43 classifications to know more

<p>Is mankind alone in the universe? Or are there somewhere other intelligent beings looking up into their night sky from very different 
worlds and asking the same kind of question? Are there civilizations more advanced than ours, civilizations that have achieved interstellar 
communication and have established a network of linked societies throughout our galaxy? Such questions, bearing on the deepest problems of
the nature and destiny of mankind, were long the exclusive province of theology and speculative fiction. Today for the first time in human
history they have entered into the realm of experimental science.

From the movements of a number of nearby stars, we have now detected unseen companion bodies in orbit around them that are about as massive
as large planets. From our knowledge of the processes by which life arose here on the earth, we know that similar processes must be fairly
common throughout the universe. Since intelligence and technology have a high survival value it seems likely that primitive life forms on
the planets of other stars, evolving over many billions of years, would occasionally develop intelligence, civilization, and high technology. 
Moreover, we on earth now possess all the technology necessary for communicating with other civilizations in the depths of space. Indeed, 
we may now be standing on a threshold about to take the momentous step a planetary society takes but once: first contact with another 
civilization...

In our present ignorance of how common extraterrestrial life may actually be, any attempt to estimate the number of technical civilizations 
in our galaxy is necessarily unreliable. We do, however, have some relevant facts. There is reason to believe that solar systems are formed 
fairly easily and that they are abundant in the vicinity of the sun. In our own solar system, for example, there are three miniature 
"solar systems": the satellite systems of the planets Jupiter (with 13 moons), Saturn (with 10), and Uranus (with five). [EDITORS' NOTE: 
the number of known satellites has increased greatly since the time that this article was written.] It is plain that however such systems 
are made, four of them formed in our immediate neighborhood.</p>
